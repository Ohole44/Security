Tools:
Wazuh
TheHive

I choose to host my Wazuh and Hive servers through DigitalOcean to save compute power for my attack and victim VMs that run on my local host. This requires payment.

You can choose to install Wazuh or the Hive on an Ubuntu VM that runs on your host machine. The install instructions will be the same. I also choose to use VirtualBox to manage my VMs.
