Overview:

This guide will walk you through the steps of building two servers.
One will host Wazuh, a SIEM tool and the other will host TheHive, an alert/case management tool.
I choose to host these servers on DigitalOcean. This guide will walk through the steps of creating a DigitalOcean Droplet, establishing firewall rules
